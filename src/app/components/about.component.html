        Save the Children
    </a>
    is a global, nonprofit organization serving children in 120 countries around the world. <br><br>

    We give children a healthy start, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. We aim to inspire 
    breakthroughs in the way the world treats children, and to achieve immediate and lasting change in childrens 
    lives by improving their health, education and economic opportunities. Save the Children invests in childhood - 
    everyday, in times of crisis and for our future. In times of acute crisis, we mobilize rapid assistance to help 
    children recover from the effects of war, conflict and natural disasters. <br><br>

    Recognized for our commitment to accountability, innovation and collaboration, 
    our work takes us into the heart of communities, where we help children and families 
    help themselves. We work with other organizations, governments, non-profits and a variety of local 
    partners while maintaining our own independence without political agenda or religious orientation. <br><br>
    
    We are one of the most trusted, efficient and effective charitable organizations in the world. 
    We have received Charity Navigator's* highest 4-star rating for 14 years in a row. <br><br>
