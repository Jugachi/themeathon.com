    <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
    We are Themeathon, a speedrunning marathon for charity founded by Lordmau5 and Jugachi in 2016. <br> <br>

    Currently we are streaming the pre-marathon, a 24 hour online marathon raising money for Save the Chlidren. <br> <br>

    The official marathon will be themed; guiding the breadth of content provided to you by our lovely hosts.
    If you have a run, feel welcome to submit for the official marathon! Don't worry about conforming to the theme,
    it's not required for any runs. <br> <br>

    breakthroughs in the way the world treats children, and to achieve immediate and lasting change in childrens 
    lives by improving their health, education and economic opportunities. Save the Children invests in childhood -

    our work takes us into the heart of communities, where we help children and families
